1. Load data from the CSV foile github repo
2. Performed experiment for the data (EDA, Feature engineering, model building, model evaluation)
3. Code for data_ingestion.py
4. Then code for data pre-processing
5. Then code for feature engineering
6. Now code for model_building.py
    > model building: added params.yaml file for modular code & saving model into folder(model)
    > load_params() function added in data_ingestion and model_building including yaml module (all working)
7. Code for model_evaluation.py
    > save the matrics of the evaluation
